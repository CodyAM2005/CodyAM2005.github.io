        <p>
          Our team, the Lollipop Lickers, took notes to brainstorm some ideas for a way to improve captchas. We compiled all of these into an affinity diagram, with the titles, "Base Ideas", "Captcha Problems", "What is Captcha doing right?", "Restrictions", and "Potential Solutions".

          My persona's person is Mark Jones. He says "Fortnite is important but Fortnite is importanter," and he is a developer for Epic Games. He dislikes Captcha's, because his career requires logging into multiple accounts, which becomes tedious.

          My storyboard has a main character, which was my persona Mark Jones. He gets to work, but because of all the accounts he handles, he has to do CAPTCHAs all day which takes away from his productivity. He wants a faster and easier CAPTCHA experience.
